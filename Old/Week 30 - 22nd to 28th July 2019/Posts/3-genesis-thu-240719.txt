Post Title: genesis
1st Draft : 24th July 2017, Thursday

Since time immemorial we have been seeking our dear lost ones, among the stars. Whenever we have been lost in their thoughts, we have looked up to the sky, in order to find some solace, may be even try to 'find' them itself.

It seems more like a tale cooked up to pacify young children who are distraught at losing their parents / grand-parents at tender age, and are too young to be described about the cycle of life-and-death; but slowly over a period of time, even for grown-ups, the only place to find some 'comfort' at the thought of their departed ones, has been the sky and more often than not a star lit sky at night.

This is where you find, 'your star' and every night it is there, reminding one of their loved 1's omni-presence, the fact they are far away, but yet not too far.

And this has been the very genesis of MSC (Memoir Space Company). In today's time when we have the technology to reach 'very high' in to sky, can we make possible to fly the memories of our 'loved 1s' in to sky and make them sort of permanent there, like a star?

This is what MSC intends to do [insert link]
