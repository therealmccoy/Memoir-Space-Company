As of 0609 hrs on Wednesday, 31st July 2019 the original idea submitted to Startup School 2019 has been pivoted, in just about a week's time.

There has been ramblings inside me since watching the video of 1st Week in which Kevin talks about the Problem aspect of idea and what makes a great idea.

All the previous posts which total 7 in number has now been labelled as "OLD IDEA", including the first post here.

Now the Startup School Participant is - Moonshine Training School.

What It Will Do: Training for small restaurant and hotel workers of India.

What It Will Make: App for training of hospitality employees of small restaurants and hotels of India, through video.
