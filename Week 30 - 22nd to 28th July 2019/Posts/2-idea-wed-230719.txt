Memoir Space Company would launch, maintain and track satellites, on which 'everyone' can send memoirs of their 'loved 1s' in space.

The idea is to let everyone part of this 'Space Renaissance' which is unfolding right now, in the middle of 2019, as we speak.

While there are companies abound now who are building rockets, satellites, kinds of SpaceX and Blue Origin, who do everything; a common man, who is really excited about 'space' and what is unfolding (we have just celebrated the 50th anniversary of Apollo 11 landing) is not really being able to 'participate' in the events and is reduced to a bystander, whose existence is limited to 'clapping'.

MSC (Memoir Space Company) would give everyone (well, almost!) a chance to be part of this 'space exploration'.

And the way it intends to do is to let people fly the memoirs (tiny / small) in to space, via satellite. In such a simple way, they could be part of this 'space odyssey', right from launch to tracking of satellites and communicating with it.

What was mostly science fiction for a common man, seen in movies, would be now possible.

The satellite would be parked in Low Earth Orbit (LEO)  Customers can 'follow' and track 'their' satellite. Special moments can be shared with friends & family. and thus, memories can be cherished and celebrated in a novel manner.

 In such a simple way, they could be part of this 'space odyssey', right from launch to tracking of satellites and communicating with it.
